        description: "JusJax was a university project where I designed a website for a small, family-run organic shop. The focus was on creating a warm, natural aesthetic that reflects the brandâ€™s values of sustainability, quality, and healthy living. The site highlights product ranges, customer reviews, and an approachable brand identity while keeping the design simple, clean, and user-friendly.",
